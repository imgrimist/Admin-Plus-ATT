## **Intro --------------------------------------------------**

Admin-Plus allows you to do admin abilities all ingame.

To run abilities on players you need to "select" them.

To select/deselect a player, cycle through `deselectMode`, `selectMode`, and `offMode` by breaking blue crystals (offMode does just turns off both modes).
While you have deselect/select Mode enabled, enter combat with the user you would like to select/deselect.

(To start the bot, open the folder's command prompt and type `node .`
